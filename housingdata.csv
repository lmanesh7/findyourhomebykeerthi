I am looking to sell to someone with a good job history and a strong down payment. The house is 3 bedrooms, with 2 bathrooms beautiful historic homebuilt in the early 1900s and has been fully remodeled. Hardwood floors throughout, 12 ft ceilings, original fireplace mantles, intricate trim work and built-ins. Well updated with gas fireplace, tankless water heater, new kitchen appliances, and a 5 year old metal roof to name a few updates.  Best Part is we are owner financing which means no bank qualifying. I usually get 10-20% down on owner financed houses, so reach out to me if this is something you may be interested in. The total sales price is $159,900, and the monthly payment will be at or around $1,370 (piti) depending on your down payment. I will not bother with a credit check. I will use your income as qualification (must have the down payment and 3x the monthly payment in verifiable income). F & Qs 1. Do I own the home? Do I have a closing? We close with a local title company or closing attorney. You own the home. We take back the note just like a bank. 2. What is the rate and down payment? Down payment and rate depend on income, but it is not unusual to get $15k -$20k down. Sometimes we get more. We usually do your payment on a 20- or 30-year term, no balloons or prepayment penalties. 3. What if I make changes to the home? ItÃ¢Â€Â™s your home, make it your home. All we are worried about are the payments being make on time. Feel free to make changes to YOUR home. 4. I am interested in the home and have a reasonable down payment, how do I see the home?  Email us with your down payment and when you are wanting to move. We will set up a reasonable time to see the home.",31.7248,-83.2495,ga

I am looking to sell to someone with a good job history and a strong down payment. The house is 4 bedrooms, with 3 bathrooms and an inground pool. The kitchen has had some updating while other parts of the house will need some cosmetic work. You can do improvements while you live there! I usually get 10-20% down on owner financed houses, so reach out to me if this is something you may be interested in. The total sales price is $129,000, and the monthly payment will be at or around $950 depending on your down payment. I will not bother with a credit check. I will use your income as qualification (must have the down payment and 3x the monthly payment in verifiable income). F & Qs 1. Do I own the home? Do I have a closing? We close with a local title company or closing attorney. You own the home. We take back the note just like a bank. 2. What is the rate and down payment? Down payment and rate depend on income, but it is not unusual to get $15k -$20k down. Sometimes we get more. We usually do your payment on a 20- or 30-year term, no balloons or prepayment penalties. 3. What if I make changes to the home? ItÃ¢Â€Â™s your home, make it your home. All we are worried about are the payments being make on time. Feel free to make changes to YOUR home. 4. I am interested in the home and have a reasonable down payment, how do I see the home?  Email us with your down payment and when you are wanting to move. We will set up a reasonable time to see the home.",31.7248,-83.2495,ga
